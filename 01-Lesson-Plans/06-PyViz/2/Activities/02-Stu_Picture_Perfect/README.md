# Picture Perfect

Still in your role as a data analyst for a video streaming service, you have now been asked by your manager to compare and contrast the revenue numbers by quarter for the various international regions.

The results of your analysis will be presented at the board meeting so you need to make sure your visualisations are picture perfect.  Using the customisation attributes and options demonstrated by the instructor, curate your visualisations. Make sure to assess each plot for opportunities of aesthetic improvement.

Be sure to consult the [HvPlot Customization](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Customization.html) page for additional opportunities of aesthetic improvement.

## Instructions

1. Open the [starter file](Unsolved/picture_perfect.ipynb), and create a Pandas DataFrame from the `regional_revenue.csv` file that is located in the `Resources` folder.

2. Create a line plot that visualises the growth in revenue for the “United States and Canada” region.

3. Add x- and y-axis labels to your plot. Rotate the x-axis plot ticks 45 degrees.

4. Add a title to the US and Canada revenue plot.

5. Use the `yformatter` option to format y-axis values.

6. Add a `line_color` of blue and `hover_line_color` of yellow to the plot.

7. Save the plot you just created to a variable so that it can later be used in an overlay plot.

8. Create a line plot that visualises the growth in revenue for the “Europe, Middle East, and Africa” region. Style the plot with the same options used in the first plot, but make the `line_color` equal to orange. Save this plot to a variable.

9. Create an overlay plot for the "United States and Canada" and the "Europe, Middle East and Africa" regions.

10. Add a title to the overlay plot. Adjust height, width, and background colour.

    > Hint: The `opts` function can be used to customize composite plots by using the following code: `(plot_state_avgs * plot_2015_2016 * plot_2010_2014).opts(bgcolor="lightgrey")`.

11. **Bonus:** Add stylised line plots for the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions and include them in the overlay plot.
