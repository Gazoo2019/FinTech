## 24.1 Lesson Plan: Final Projects!

---

### Overview

Most of this class will center on project work. You and the TAs should check up on each group and make sure they're moving smoothly toward Saturday's presentations.

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should have the entirety of class to work on their projects.

* Make sure your students make measurable progress with their project work.

##### Instructor Notes

Your students will be nearing the end of their projects. Even though it's the beginning of the week, you should push students to finish their projects before the next class, so they have optimum time to practice their presentations.

It's crucial that you steer any off-course projects back on track. Come next class; the encroaching Saturday deadline will mire any attempt at a turnaround.

The remaining schedule for Project 3 is as follows:

* Today and the Next Class:

  * Students are given all of class to work on projects.

* Saturday:

  * Students present their projects!

### Class Objectives

* Students work on their group projects.

---

### 1. Welcome Class (5 min)

Say your hellos and check if students have any questions about past concepts.

### 2. Instructor Do: Ask About Projects (5 min)

Tell your students how you're excited to see the projects they'll present on Saturday. You should talk about how you're impressed with the concepts they've come up with and that they should feel proud about working toward the goals they devised after spending just eight weeks in this course.

Ask the class about their thoughts on the collaboration experience so far and about any lingering sources of anxiety they might have as they near closer to presentation day.

* Answer these reassuringly—if you ever had similar doubts, chime in with your experiences on overcoming them.

* If no one says anything, they're likely apprehensive about admitting fears to their classmates. Assure them that if they're anxious about their project work, then no doubt other students feel the same way. Encourage them to share these thoughts—talking about them is an essential step to overcoming them.

### 3. Student Do: Project Work (1 hour, 20 minutes)

Have your students sit with their project groups. Tell the class they should try as best they can to finish 95% of their code and design by the end of the class. That would give them most of the week to spend on documentation and presentations.

Add that they should come into the next class expecting to devote at least 30 minutes to outline their presentations. They'll also have time to work on the rest of their projects.

TAs and instructors: For the next 90 minutes, you're senior developers! Walk around the class as mentors for each group's team. Ask them about their progress so far; offer them advice on how they can finish their work in time.

* Maybe a member of the team finished all the work their role entailed. Perhaps they're waiting for other people to complete a certain task before they can continue. Make sure any students in these situations ask their teammates how else they can help.

* Some students might be stumped by technology that they hadn't gone over in class but are trying to use in their project. See if you can help out. If you're not familiar with the tech, direct the encumbered student to someone on the Boot Camp team who is.

* Slack out the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NHVd0b1oymAn8EYmw2Wu8SGj4XxkJ2CJeN1GCzLZr9M/edit?usp=sharing). Let the students know that using this template is **not** a requirement of the project, however it could prove useful to some groups as they begin organizing their presentations.  Explain to the students that this example format is organized as follows:

  * **Executive summary:** Briefly explain your project and how it relates to fintech and financial programming.
  * **Concept:** What is your user story? What was your motivation for choosing this topic?
  * **Data Collection, Cleanup, and Exploration:** Describe your data source, why you chose it, and how you collected, explored, and cleaned your data.
  * **Approach:** What technologies did you use? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
  * **Demo:** Show your stuff!
  * **Next Steps:** Discuss any additional questions that surfaced, what your group might research next if more time was available, or share a plan for future development. 
  * **Links:** Share links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.

* Ensure that all teams seem prepared to complete their projects by the end of the module.
