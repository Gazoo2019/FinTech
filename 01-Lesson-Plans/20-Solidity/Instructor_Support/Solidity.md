# Solidity Instructor Resources

Solidity is a programming language for smart contracts that runs on many blockchains&mdash;namely, Ethereum-compatible chains.

It was inspired by Javascript, C++, and Python.

The [Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides fantastic resources that go through what the language is for and how it works.

The [Solidity by Example collection](https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-by-example) provides short and sweet examples of smart contracts for quickly learning the language.

We recommend following the [Solidity Tutorial & Ethereum Blockchain Programming Course](https://cryptozombies.io/) by CryptoZombies to get in-depth practice that should quickly energize your Solidity skills&mdash;especially if you’re already familiar with other programming languages.
