## Requesting Tokens

## Troubleshooting

Depending on the Ropsten network status, you might be greylisted for a particular amount of time, as the following image shows:

![Ropsten - 2](Images/ropsten-2.png)

Notice that the preceding image indicates that you are greylisted for another 0 hours and 59 minutes.

If this happens, you can use any of the following solutions:

* Wait for the greylisted time to expire before asking for test ether.

* Use a different wallet address.

* Use a wallet that we’ve created for instructors. Add the wallet to MetaMask by using the following mnemonic phrase:

  `invest pool ribbon damage balance once digital oil lucky utility session tuition`

The instructor wallet usually has enough test ether to run the activities in Unit 20. Please report any missing funds to the FinTech Curriculum Team via the #05-fintech channel in Slack.

**Important:** Don’t share this wallet with the students.
